Nitrogen (N)

Phosphorus (P)

Potassium (K)

Soil pH

Temperature

Humidity

Rainfall

Supports multiple machine learning models for accurate crop prediction

Provides real-time analysis and recommendations

Flask-based web interface for user-friendly interactions




<h2>Model</h2>  

FarmSmart employs various machine learning models, including:

Naive Bayes

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Support Vector Machine (SVM)
